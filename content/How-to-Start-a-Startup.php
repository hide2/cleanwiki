=blue <h1>1. Why you should start a startup - Dustin Moskovitz</h1>
-------------------------
The Best Reason: `You Can't Not Do It`
- `Passion`: You need to do it
You'll need passion to endure The Struggle
You'll need passion to effectively recruit
- `Aptitude`: The world needs you to do it
    - The world needs it
Otherwise do something that the world needs
    - The world needs you
It's bad for the world if you just outcompete a team with more aptitude
The world needs you somewhere - find where

  
>创业只有一个原因：你不得不去创业，因为命运选择了你
你拥有要去做这件事的难以抑制的激情+这个世界需要这个东西+你拥有做这件事的最好的天赋

=blue <h1>2. Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution - Sam Altman</h1>
-------------------------
=blue Ideas
The `Idea` comes first
The company should feel like an important `mission`
  
=blue Products
Build something users `love`
Talk to users
Show it to users -> `User feedback` -> Product Decisions loop
- What do they like?
- What would they pay for?
- What would make them recommend it?

Metrics: Focus on `growth`
- Total registrations
- Active users
- Activity Levels
- Cohort Retention
- Revenue
- Net Promoter Score

  
=blue Teams
Cofounders should be `Relentlessly Resourceful`
You are looking for co-founders that need to be unflappable, tough, know what to do in every situation, act quickly, decisive, creative, ready for anything
Know your cofounders
Try not to hire
Get the best people
Mediocre engineers do not build great companies
- Are they smart?
- Do they get things done?
- Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?
- Good communication skills
- Manically determined
- Pass the animal test
- Would feel comfortable reporting to them

You’ve hired the best - now keep them around!
Fire fast

  
=blue Execution
The CEO has five jobs
- Set the vision
- Raise money
- Evangelize
- Hire and manage
- Make sure the entire company executes

Focus
- What are you spending time and money on? opera
- What are the two or three most important things?
- Say no. A lot.
- Set overarching goals. Repeat them
- Communicate
- Maintain growth and momentum
- Work together in person

Intensity
- Relentless operating rhythm
- Obsession with Execution Quality
- Bias towards action
- Quick
- Do Whatever it takes
- Show up
- Don't give up
- Be courageous

Always keep momentum
Always keep growing
Set an operation rhythm
- Shipping product
- Launching new features
- Reviewing/reporting metrics and milestones

The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.
Don't spend more money than you have

>尽量找熟知的合伙人
从同行里找到优秀的合伙人
最好有两三个合伙人
员工越多不一定越好
创业初期尽量少招人，减少成本
为自己的公司找最优秀的人才
最好找与你一样相信公司，并符合你期待的人
要熟悉每个你雇佣的人
要以期权的形式分配股份
股份的分配最好在公司建立之初就和合伙人协商好
在执行方面，首先要清楚自己要做什么，其次就是是否能完成
如果你知道自己要做什么，剩下的就是专注和保持增长势头
要在许多事情中选出自己觉得最重要的做，而不是漫无目的
要让整个公司都清楚目标
保持增长势头可以鼓舞士气，保持信心，一切问题都迎刃而解
无视你的竞争者，不要让他们破坏你的增长势头

=blue <h1>3. Counterintuitive Parts of Startups, and How to Have Ideas - Paul Graham</h1>
-------------------------

>创业中反直觉的几条原则
不能一味跟着直觉走
成功创业需要的并不是创业知识专家
找诀窍在创业中是行不通的
创业比想象中的还要艰辛
创业前途未卜
获得创意的方法就是不去刻意想创意

![YC](https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1511371972652&di=cc0b61f90f318ae83c70ee9649a62fbd&imgtype=0&src=http%3A%2F%2Fa4.att.hudong.com%2F60%2F45%2F01300000354882123876458091228.gif)

  
=blue <h1>4. Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing - Adora Cheung</h1>
-------------------------
>选择行业，并对该行业有所了解
简单定义企业特点，明确客户群体，实地营销
关注客户价值
建立良好的宣传和推荐机制
三种增长模式 - 高粘度增长、病毒式增长、付费增长
要坚持创意同时也要在适当的时机学会放弃，找到适合自己的创业路子

在3年里pivot了12次，终于获得$37M融资把Homejoy做起来
师兄的今日头条也是一个积极pivot并走向成功的例子
另一个案例是一个同学做微商，一直没有增长，半死不活的状态坚持了很多年，其实他早该pivot
现实中大多数创业团队都需要转型，而且关键在于转型的速度和质量

=warn 可惜的是，作为共享经济、O2O的鼻祖企业，Homejoy于2015年倒闭。

![HomeJoy](https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1511521689764&di=17f13ba129bd6f302405205f37dba63a&imgtype=0&src=http%3A%2F%2Fimage.sowm.cn%2Fm2EZRv.gif)

  
=blue <h1>5. Business Strategy and Monopoly Theory - Peter Thiel</h1>
-------------------------
`Competition is for losers`
- capturing value
    - X*Y%
- lies people tell
- how to build a monopoly
    Characteristics of Monopoly
    - proprietary technology
    - network effects
    - economies of scale
    - branding
- last mover advantage
- history of innovation
    Success cases
    - Vertically integrated complex monopolies
    Ford, Standard Oil, Tesla, SpaceX
    - Software
    economies of scale, low marginal cost, high adoption rate
- psychology of competition

>衡量一个公司的价值的方法，创造X美元的价值，并把其中的Y%把握在自己手中，X和Y是独立的
形成垄断的重要切入点是进入小的市场，并迅速占领这个市场，因为大的市场竞争非常激烈，所有的价值都在竞争中消耗掉了
虽然第一个吃螃蟹的人很勇敢，但最重要的是要做笑到最后的人，因此必须不断创新，保持竞争力
跨界融合式创新可能更容易成功，如Tesla
软件很容易成为爆点，因为边际成本为0，如Google、Facebook
不要拘泥于完全竞争的弹丸之地，转角你可能会发现巨大的机会
精益创业无用，伟大的公司都是做出巨大的改变以和其他人区别开来

=info PT是那种长远思考、一眼看到底、预见未来的人，在PT眼里精益创业根本就是浪费时间瞎碰运气

=blue <h1>6. Growth - Alex Schultz</h1>
-------------------------
>对于网站，用户留存率是最重要的，而这则取决于产品的好坏，因此先要做好产品
`选对增长目标，制造激动时刻`
Airbnb的激动时刻就是你发现了一个很酷的房间，在你推门进去的那一刻
比如Facebook的激动时刻就是看到你的朋友也在使用它
Facebook的第一个增长目标就是专注于让用户14天内找到10个朋友，使用户体验激动时刻
Facebook的第二个增长目标是国际化
病毒式营销：Payload、Frequency、CR

=blue <h1>9. How to Raise Money - Marc Andreessen</h1>
-------------------------
>Is this person a leader?
Is this person rightful, focused, and obsessed by the product?
Say in one compelling sentence so that the investor immediately can picture the product in their own mind
Key to success is be so good they can't ignore you

=blue Onion theory of risk:
- make a list of risks
- running a startup & raising money is a process of peeling away layers of risk
- raise seed money to peel away the first two or three risks(founding team, product)
- raise A round to peel away the next level of risks(product, recruiting, customer)
- peeling away your risk by achieving milestones, both making progress in business and justifying raising more capital
- I raised a seed round, I achieved these milestones, I eliminated these risks, I raised the A round, I achieved these milestones, I eliminated these risks, now I am raising a B round, here are my milestones, here are my risks, and by the time I go to raise a C round, here is the state I will be in, and calibrate the amound of money you raise and spend to the risks that you are pulling out of the business

=blue <h1>12. Sales and Marketing - Aaron Levie</h1>
-------------------------
=blue Listen to customers
But don't always build exactly what they want.
Build what they need.

  
=blue Modularize, don't customize
Every customer will want something a little bit different. 
Don't make the product suffer for this.
Open APIs as a way of delivering vertical or custom experiences.

  
=blue Focus on the user
Keep "consumer" DNA at the core of your enterprise product.
This will always pay dividends.

  
=blue Your product should sell itself
Sales should be used to navigate customers and close deals, not be a substitute for great product.

Have two or three people on a team rather than a solar founder is much better
There' this very broad set of skills. There's this whole set of questions about how you adapt your company in order to be successful.
If you have two or three founders, you have different skills, you can compensate for each other's weaknesses
You can in the diversity of problems that you encounter as a founder that you can actually attack them

=blue Location
When you're founding a company, go to where it's successful to this
`Entrepreneurship is jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down`

  
=blue Contrarian
What's the way that what do I know that other people don't know?
Go talk to every smart person who will talk to you and give you feedback, think about how is it that smart people disagree with me? AND there's something that I know that they don't know that actually in fact will play out to be true.

-------------------------
做一个公司比做一个产品难多了，根本的原因在于人是非理性的
打造一个公司就像是要把所有这些不理性的人，放在同一个屋子里然后和他们一天至少生活12个小时
A manager's output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence
`打造一个公司就像打造一个引擎`
`像编辑一样运营一个公司 - Editing`
- Simplify（精简，提炼 - 问题）
- Clarify（阐明，精准 - 目标）
- Allocate Resources（轻重缓急）
- Ensure Consistent Voice（步调一致）
- Delegate（熟练则放权，监控和设定目标；不熟练则详细监控，控制进度）
Task-Relevant Maturity:
Low - Highly structured: what, when, how
High - Monitor and set objectives

-------------------------
When making a critical decision, you must understand how it will be interpreted from each person's point of view and its impact on the union of the individual views. i.e. culture
- Do you demote or fire?
- An excellent employee asks you for a raise

=blue It's not your perspective or the perspective of the person that you are talking to at the moment that matters.
=blue You must consider the people who are not in the room.
